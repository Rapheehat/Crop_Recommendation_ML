# Comparing Classification Algorithms For Crop Recommendation In Precision Agriculture Using Machine Learning
This repository presents an ML model designed to recommend the most suitable crop(s) based on various factors such as soil type, rainfall, and temperature. The objective is to aid farmers in resource optimization and profit maximization by selecting the appropriate crop for their specific conditions.Various ML algorithms like Random Forests, Gradient Boost, and Decision Trees are tested for their effectiveness in predicting ideal crops based on soil and weather conditions.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [Crop Recommendation Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/siddharthss/crop-recommendation-dataset) from Kaggle. The dataset contains 8 columns and 2200 rows. These columns include soil nutrients, pH, and weather conditions, while the label column encompasses 22 crop types like rice, maize, chickpea, and kidney beans.

## Usage
To use the code in this repository:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure Python and the required libraries are installed.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook or Python script containing the model implementation.
4. Run the code to train the model, evaluate its performance, and analyze the results.

## Discussion

Random Forest emerged as the top-performing algorithm with high accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. However, Na√Øve Bayes, Gradient Boost, and Decision Trees also showed promising results. The study highlights the significance of temperature, rainfall, humidity, and soil nutrients in crop recommendation.

## Conclusion

This project underscores the potential of Machine Learning in precision agriculture for crop recommendation. By leveraging data on soil conditions, weather patterns, and crop history, ML models can offer optimal crop recommendations, leading to improved yields and sustainability. While the Random Forest model excelled in accuracy, other algorithms also showed promise.
